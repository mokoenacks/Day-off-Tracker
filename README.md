# Day-off-Tracker
a day off tracker inspired by my internships leave policy that indicates for every 17 days that pass an intern gets 1 day off
A user can view their available days off that they've accumulated and future day off by pressing the button
A user can request a day off by pressing the take day off button which will prompt input of the number of days they want to tak
if the day off is greater the available its respond to that condition with correction
if charecter or decimal is entered it'll respond accordingly
